# TetriSH
A brand-new way of wasting time.
## What is this
This is a very stupid way of communicating to the shell of your preference.
It is essentially the game of Tetris, but the blocks contain text characters,
and by clearing a line you send that line to the shell.

Please do something productive instead.
